# BMI-calculator App

## About this project
This project was a collaboration between https://github.com/ViaMarcus and https://github.com/designerofthing.
It is a single page web application allowing the user to calculate their BMI from height and weight in both metric and imperial units.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
The project also uses [SemanticUI](https://semantic-ui.com/) mixed with custom CSS for styling.

The application's features are tested using Cypress.
